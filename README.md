# pancake-case
Redesigned case for the Venti_FBT Cheesecake style PCB for SlimeVR.

Reuses the straps and button switch from the original Cheesecake/new 3.0 style "Chonky" trackers. Check SlimeVR Discord for compatible tracker.

Warning: does not come with any solid mounting options for the battery. The PCB snaps into place fairly well, but I should add a screw or something.

### Main changes
The PCB is very small, so instead of stacking the battery underneath the IMU, I put it above, reducing the height to only 10mm. It's quite a bit longer, but FAR more comfortable.

### Subjective Improvements
- Flatter, so closer to your body with more surface area
- Integrated "Brackle" for less movement
- the hook for standard straps hooks onto the lids' hook, and is snug, so it can sit nicely on an angle for funny shaped feet or small ankles
- Stays in place better
- only two printed parts instead of 2 + a clip
- SUPER comfortable. Arguably one of the lowest volume trackers possible.
- Smaller cubic volume than the original 3.0, substantially less than the Cheesecake, and significantly less than official trackers.

### Caveats
- The clip is weak, and can potentially fall off with huge movements. This can be fixed by looping over the tracker with the strap though
- No screws, and thinner walls means potentially less durable
- Lid can be simplified further for faster printing and less points to break.
